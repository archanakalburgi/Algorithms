merge sort : merging two sorted arrys to get one single sorted array. 

A, B are two sorted list 
C is a sorted list of A and B combined 


2 ways of merge sort :
    1. two - way merge 
    2. merge sort 

    2-way merge sort : iterative process -> using loop 
        - assume that every element is a list in itself 
        - given one array of elements, assume this is an array of lists of a single element 
        - so all elements in the list will be sorted 
        - now have to merge these lists to get a single sorted list 
        - using 2-way merge methode merge all the lists 
    

    merge sort : recursive 
        - divide and conquer preocedure 
            - divide the problems into sub problems - smaller problems 
            - solve the smaller problems 
            - combine the smaller solution to get the solution for the bigger problems
        - in merge sort a single element is the smallest problem
