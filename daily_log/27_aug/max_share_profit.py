price_list = [100,113,110,85,105,102,86,200] 

max_profit = 200-85 = 115 
(buy at 85 and sell at 200)

iterative approach:
    - for every price calculate the difference with every other price of the share 
    - keep tack of the maximum differance
    - requires two for loop 
    - time complexity : n^2
    - 

2nd approach :
    - walk through the array 

    - let price_list[0] = minimum price (this the price we have purchased at)

    - move to next price 

    - check if this price < minimum price 
        if true :
            minimum = this price 
        else :
            diff = this_price - previous_price 
    
    - store the diff 

    - return max diff (max diff = max profit)

    - repeat above for all prices 

    - only 1 for loop required 

    - time complexity = O(n)
