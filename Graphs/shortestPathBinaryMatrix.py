1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

In an N by N square grid, each cell is either empty (0) or blocked (1).

A clear lengthOfPath from top-left to bottom-right has length k if and only if it is 
composed of cells C_1, C_2, ..., C_k 

such that:
    Adjacent cells C_i and C_{row+1} are connected 8-directionally 
    (ie., they are different and share an edge or corner)

    C_1 is at location (0, 0) (ie. has value grid[0][0])

    C_k is at location (N-1, N-1) (ie. has value grid[N-1][N-1])

    If C_i is located at (r, c), then grid[r][c] is empty (ie. grid[r][c] == 0).

Return the length of the shortest such clear lengthOfPath from top-left to bottom-right.  
If such a lengthOfPath does not exist, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 4

Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100
grid[r][c] is 0 or 1
