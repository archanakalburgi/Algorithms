1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

Given the node of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the node of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, 
the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, 
is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with node A.
Note: This question is the same as 865:

Example 1:

Input: node = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but 
the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.


Example 2:

Input: node = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The node is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.

Example 3:

Input: node = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
0 <= Node.val <= 1000
The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
